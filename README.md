# 2015 Advent of Code solutions

These are my solutions for the 2015 [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) puzzles. As i'm a webdeveloper i've tried to solve every puzzle mostly with javascript, occasionally falling back on for instance PHP when javascript did not have the needed functionality.

If you've got any feedback, get in touch with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/arrayofemotions).
